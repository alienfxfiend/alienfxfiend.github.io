One night a guy &amp; a girl were<br />
driving home from the movies. The<br />
boy sensed there was<br />
something wrong because of the painful<br />
silence they shared between them<br />
that night. The girl then asked the boy to pull over<br />

feelings had changed &amp; that it was time to move on.<br />

slowly reached into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded note.<br />
At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down<br />
that very same street. He swerved<br />
right into the drivers seat, killing the boy.<br />

              <center>-[ Nihilism New Excerpts ]-</center>
              The rejection of that which requires faith for salvation or actualization and would span to include anything from theology to secular ideology. Within nihilism faith and similar values are discarded because they've no verifiable objective substance, they are invalid serving only as yet another exploitable lie never producing any strategically beneficial outcome. Faith is an imperative hazard to group and individual because it compels suspension of reason, critical analysis and common sense. Nietzsche once said that faith means not wanting to know. Faith is 'don't let those pesky facts get in the way of our political plan or our mystically ordained path to heaven'; faith is 'do what I tell you because I said so'. All things that can't be disproved need faith, utopia needs faith, idealism needs faith, and spiritual salvation needs faith. Abolish faith!<br /><br />

Nihilism is primarily skepticism coupled with reduction, but in practical reality it takes on more than one facet which often leads to a confusion of definitions. In the most general sense nihilism has two major classifications, the first is passive and usually goes by the term existential or 'social' nihilism and the second is active and is termed 'political' nihilism.<br /><br />

Existential nihilism is a passive world view which revolves around such topics as suffering and futility, and even has connections to Eastern mysticism like Buddhism. In a more direct sense existential 'social' nihilism is manifest within the sense of isolation, futility, angst, and the hopelessness of existence increasingly prevalent within the modern digital world, an effect referred to as the 'downward spiral'. A direct way to describe it might be 'detachment from everything'.<br /><br />

Words used to describe political nihilism include active, revolutionary, destructive, and even creative. Political nihilism is dictionary defined as the realization "that conditions in the social organization are so bad as to make destruction desirable for its own sake independent of any constructive program or possibility." It deals with authority and social structures rather than simply the introspective, personal emotions of existential nihilism.<br /><br />

Nihilism	When conditions in the social organization are so unhealthy as to make destruction desirable for its own sake independent of any constructive program or possibility.<br /><br />

In Russia, nihilism became identified with a loosely organized revolutionary movement (C.1860-1917) that rejected the authority of the state, church, and family. ... The movement advocated a social arrangement based on rationalism and materialism as the sole source of knowledge and individual freedom as the highest goal. By rejecting man's spiritual essence in favor of a solely materialistic one, nihilists denounced God and religious authority as antithetical to freedom.
From: The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy<br /><br />

Mikhael Bakunin in the 19th century who succinctly reflected the nihilist sentiment with his famous statement: "Let us put our trust in the eternal spirit which destroys and annihilates only because it is the unsearchable and eternally creative source of all."<br /><br />

The Nihilist realizes that history is abused and misconstrued through the formation of artificial lines and erroneous connections between disparate events, only to substantiate preconceived interpretations of reality, the classic teleological myth.<br /><br />

Passivity is a myth. We are all intricately enmeshed within a dynamic system that doesn't just demand but compels active decision-making.<br /><br />

It's remarkable how even a modicum of logic and scientific philosophy demonstrates the difficulty of defining what is real and the rules to describe it. Like a sandpit the more one struggles the tougher it gets. So an important value to question is objective reality. The closest match might be scientific laws which are merely consistent principles and the most powerful ones are just statistical constructs.<br /><br />

Existence is largely defined by perception because reality is contextual. If you perceive yourself to be weak and without willpower then you will find life is such. Conversely, if you perceive that you have the power to change things in your life, so it will be. In the same way we tend to find what we expect just as physicists contemplate how a photon can be both a wave and a particle. This essence doesn’t mean that practical reality is an illusion, rather it is multi-dimensional.<br /><br />

"Know your abilities well, but never be satisfied with what you can do today. 
Strive to surpass today's feats tomorrow and each day thereafter." - Kain, 
Command and Conquer Storyline<br />
<br />
"Nothing is impossible till you stop trying." - Saying<br />
<br />
"Oh but the grass is always greener on the other side, neighbours got a new car 
that you wanna drive, time is running out you wanna stay alive, we all live we 
all will die, we all live under earth and sky, there is no wrong there is no 
right, the circle only has one side" - Invisible Band "side"<br />
<br />
"Life isn't fair because what's defined as 'fair' is self-centered and the 
universe simply does not revolve around any single person."<br />
<br />
"Our universal existence isn’t some grandiose concept or a playpen for God"<br />
<br />
"Physics doesn't care, genetics is pitiless, and the whole universe doesn't give 
a damn because it is all operating on a time scale significantly longer than any 
single human life!"<br />
<br />
"If you want a theological scale-conundrum to ruminate over ask yourself who 
created God?"<br />
<br />
"Randomness is created by heat because it is the heat that causes molecules and 
atoms to move around, so literally the chaotic nature of our reality is a 
product of some mere three degrees Kelvin that our universe is currently warmed 
to!!"<br />
<br />
"Meaning truly is 'all in the mind' for your own personal perspective and 
attitude literally determines whether you live or you commit suicide; the 
physical universe doesn't care at all one way or the other and will continue 
humming away long after you're gone just as it did long before you were around."<br />
<br />
"If you wait on your ass here the avalanche will bury you"<br />
<br />
"If you can't get it right don't do it at all"<br />
<br />
"Between thought and life there is a wide abyss." <br />
<br />
"The source of life's excitement is the unknown, the chance and risk residing 
within all new encounters. Take it away, make everything predictable, knowable 
and the result is stasis, boredom, hatred for life and eventual suicide."<br />
<br />
"Just think of the simple fact that the laws of the universe and biology are all 
even capable of being comprehended with a modicum of human effort."<br />
<br />
"Free economics only enriches the already rich"<br />
<br />
"When we conclude that we each only get one life, the goal becomes painfully 
obvious, as unpleasant as the sight of the predator messily devouring the prey 
on Wild Kingdom. I think humans are the gods, but the corporal package is a 
powerful dichotomy. Worm and god side by side. We need no higher power for 
justification or success, only the desire and willpower. Each human life has the 
potential, but unless one strives to be a god they are only a worm. We can do 
anything the question is will we?"<br />
<br />
"Although evolution has no goal and our purpose may be just as elusive that 
doesn't void significance, it doesn't make action and consequence irrelevant..."<br />
<br />
"Our very identity is defined by relative connections. If you want to alter who 
you are you must control what surrounds you, what the inputs are. Identity just 
like meaning itself is largely (but not completely discounting genetic origins) 
relative to surroundings."<br />
<br />
"Artificial law is primarily an exercise in futility because forcing someone to 
be something they aren't inevitably leads to repression, perversion and anguish. 
Nihilism rejects human justice because it is based upon the whims of fashion and 
culture, meaning morality. It is not based upon fact or what actually happens, 
indeed most every historical example of morality is one of a square peg being 
forced through a round hole"<br />
<br />
Factors that made advanced life possible include the Earth's having:<br />
* The proper distance from the sun to allow development of habitat for complex 
life and ensure that water remains liquid, not vapor or ice. <br />
* The proper mass to retain atmosphere and ocean. <br />
* Plate tectonics, which act as a sort of atmospheric thermostat, build land 
masses and enhance biotic diversity. <br />
* A neighbor the size of Jupiter, not too close and not too far away, that can 
use its gravity to protect the planet from too many life-extinguishing 
collisions with comets and asteroids. <br />
* A stable orbit unperturbed by giant planets. <br />
* A large moon at the right distance to stabilize tilt, thus ensuring seasonal 
climate fluctuations that are not too severe. <br />
* Enough carbon to support development of life but not so much to allow for 
runaway greenhouse conditions. <br />
In addition, Brownlee and Ward contend, the solar system's position in the Milky 
Way galaxy also is key to life development on Earth. At the edge of the galaxy, 
many stars are too metal-poor for planet formation, while the center of the 
galaxy has extreme energy processes that would hinder complex life.<br />
<br />
If there IS extra-terrestrial life they would be far more advanced species since 
Earth is a new planet and they would have much more time for evolution! 
(possibly billions of years more)<br />
<br />
a deficit of matter appears to exist in the universe to account for the 
gravitational mechanics that are observed. Thus one conclusion is that large 
quantities of unknown or undetected matter must exist to account for the 
structure of the known universe. It could be simple like neutrinos (if they have 
enough mass and quantity) or something totally unknown yet. But one answer I 
haven’t seen explored has to do with black holes (maybe I should research Mr. 
Hawkings work?). Since black holes suck in matter and energy without producing 
anything at all in return, then logically the universe today has less matter and 
energy than it did 10-15 billion years ago when it started out. And since the 
observed distant universe is farther back in time, perhaps the 
mass-gravitational characteristics of our universe are changing. This is 
actually fairly profound because it could mean that the very laws of physics are 
changing as well.<br />
<br />
"Reality is heaven and hell at the same time! Like a beggar in a grocery store. 
So much potential for so few to gain!!"<br />
<br />
"Sex is the cheapest, most basal form of entertainment humanly possible 
(violence is second)."<br />
<br />
"The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is 
comprehensible," Albert Einstein<br />
<br />
"Life is a diversion from the inevitable ending"<br />
<br />
"Everything beyond survival consists of the search for escape; collecting money 
or toys, mindless entertainment, drugs, etc."<br />
<br />
"What is good and bad? Nothing. What does that mean? Nothing."<br />
<br />
"Parents tell kids not to swear for example but kids demand a reason to back up 
the argument, especially when the parents swear anyway."<br />
<br />
"Once you’re gone you’re gone forever but parts of you can remain physically 
through genetic continuity and memetically through fame and ideas."<br />
<br />
"All existence is struggle, life is war and peace is death; suicide is just 
getting there prematurely"<br />
<br />
"Why does it seem like when we live for today everything fails and strategic 
planning was what should have been done; yet whenever we try to plan ahead the 
results get destroyed by future events anyway?! It's all so pointless, we don't 
really know anything! Quantum fluctuations create the presents future - it's 
probably impossible to control all of the choices - how much power does one 
individual have. Besides all structures are dynamic and rely on multiple choices 
to determine the outcome."<br />
<br />
"Basically all of human endeavor is wrapped up within the inveterate quest for 
immortality; after all, if your just going to die then what's the point of 
anything?"<br />
<br />
"Sexual and maternal bonding is just Oxytocin produced by the Pitutary gland."<br />
<br />
"Everyone has their own reality. <br />
Everything is ME, I am the universe; reality is my own filmstrip."<br />
