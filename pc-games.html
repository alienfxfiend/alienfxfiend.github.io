Sometimes your basic Worker Unit will go back and forth from the resource node back to your base, giving you a bit of resource each time. Other times the player may need only to capture the resource node with units and/or build a building on top of it gain a constant flow of the resource. Occasionally, the game allows you to trade one resource for another in some way.” “Collecting natural resources can also be seen as an easy way to avoid the Unfortunate Implications of looting and pillaging, a war crime going as far back as The Roman Empire; avoiding a What the Hell, Hero? moment, because no one owns nature. Some games use Gaia's Lament as a means to do the opposite, even having it as the reason for a group In Harmony with Nature to get involved in a conflict.” “Almost every RTS has some sort of Resource gathering” “Colonization, Outpost 2, Dwarf Fortress, Dominions, {Dungeon Siege}, Earth 2160, SimCity ("Unlike RTSes, however, the only resource you need (as Mayor) is money. Power, water, and waste management are things you build with that money that are necessary to attract Sims (i.e. citizens), create jobs, and gain popularity. Since population, jobs, and popularity are (theoretically) your goal, these "resources" are actually more like the units in an RTS, i.e. the tools with which you achieve your aim. However, it is true that money works like Gold and power works like Power, as do water (with the proper infrastructure) and waste management (again, with proper infrastructure. The 2013 release adds some odd complications. Not only is water made an exhaustible (though renewable) resource, meaning you might have to keep moving water pumps in a place with a low water table, there are several optional resources that can be tapped with special buildings: coal, ore and oil.

In the early stages of the match every second counts. #2 Use the Q &amp; W keys to place buildings on the map without clicking their icons in the sidebar. This saves lots of time over the whole match. When an opponent attacks you with 5 Tanks while you have 3, this is why. #3 After building a barracks, train a few dogs &amp; use them to scout the map. It's important to see what your opponent is doing, so you can prepare or attack him where he's weak. Dogs are good for scouting because they're fast, cheap &amp; have a good sight range. #4 Use the shortkeys. D to deploy units. S to stop units. Z for waypoints. K to repair. L to sell. G to guard. X to scatter units. #5 Use Control + Shift + Left Click. This is attack to. Units will move to the spot where you clicked &amp; attack any enemy units they encounter along the way. Use this when scouting with dogs &amp; they'll eat any enemy dogs along the way. #6 When defending or attacking use fodder. Dogs are useful fodder since they're as fast as most tanks. They won't do anything against enemy tanks, but when their tanks hit your dogs instead of your tanks you'll start winning a lot of fights. When the map is runnng out of ore or you have too many miners, they are also useful fodder, since they can take a lot of damage. #7 If map has gems, go for them first. They're worth twice as much as ore. #8 Always build towards ore &amp; gems. The shorter the way for miners the faster money will come in. Base walk if you need to. #9 When map has oil, capture it sooner rather than later. The sooner you capture the derricks the more money you get from them. A nice &amp; steady flow of funds is always good. #10 Protect your miners ! When you lose a miner you lose 1400 credits you need to spend to build a new one. &amp; you don't get the funds you'd get from a miner mining during that time. #11 Always build !

              <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Slower speeds appeal to me as well too —gives you more time to contemplate your moves &amp; make judgments. However, I guess temporarily increasing speeds [in single-player] can be quite handy to increase production time. But anyone with a modicum of logic can tell the game is more breathtaking at a speed slower than the default, which is 'Fast,' so tone it down one notch (6 to 5) as I have.<br />

Mix them up. and when playing Allied players ensure your tanks are covered by at least the same amount of IFVs.Prisms outrange any other tank/defense structure in the game (including teslas and prism towers) and they have splash damage, This is why you can not just beat Prisms with Mirages. a large group of prisms will destroy Mirage tanks because they will start firing 1st and there damage will spread across all the mirages.Elite prism tanks are incredible, protect yours if you get one. Destroy the enemies at all costsIf you are lucky enough to get a yuri const yard in a crate build tank bunkers and put prisms in them......Any elite unit has improved Speed/Firepower/Armour/Range and can self repair.Elite Chronoguys will jump out of the way of jet missiles.Use Z for waypoints, Ctrl and Alt for Guard, Ctrl and number to number units, Ctrl and F keys to number areas on the map, H to take you to your primary Const yard, Ctrl for Force Fire. Double click to make a building primary, T select all units on screen of the type/s currently selected T again to select across the map.Remember its all about the ore, expand your base take strategic locations on the map, learn the maps. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> For allies dont forget the seal+ifv combo...omg this thing rocks. Also good for taking out a con-yard or key structure. Get in close, undeploy the IFV and wham, send the man in. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> What countries do you guys prefer for games?I use the British snipers when I know that infantry will be a big factor. Most of the time, I use France's Grand Cannons to suppress incoming tanks and such. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> for the Paradrop. Unlike the others, only the USA gets periodic free units. As said before, deployed GI's are pretty powerful. Garrisoned GI's are even moreso. Dropped into a vulnerable base, they become elite pretty quickly, and because you get 8, a few elites means you'll be taking out tanks rather quick.The key is getting on the ground, deployed, and out of range of enemy defensive structures. Once deployed, dogs won't make it in if you're watching for them, and neither will Spiders.A building usually raises the rank of the last guy firing, so a few small structures can make your guys elite very quickly while also crippling their base.And, think of it this way. The good ol' USA gets 1600 coins every few minutes so long as you have an Airbase. Capture an Airport? You get another airdrop(extra airports do not do this, only the USA can have two airdrops).Its not worth much unless the map has structures on it, but if it does, the USA is in a much better position than any other country. The USA can play on a map that has low resources and outresource the other player simply by never making infantry of any sort. 8 deployed GI's WILL beat just about any tank if they're all firing on it. Prism's of course are the exception.This also means that the USA is the ONLY country(besides perhaps Yuri) without a special country unit. NO Black eagles, no (worthless) tank destroyers, no grand cannons, no snipers.But trust me, free units makes it worthwhile, especially because infantry in RA2 do NOT suck ass like they did in RA. Well, GI's don't anyway.------BTW, when playing against a Yuri player, has anyone ever found a use for those free'd slave miners? They're slow, they do almsot no damage, and they're stupid. Why bother freeing them? <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Well Yuri's revenge and plain ol' RA2 are much different, especially when it comes to quick rushes. Yuri's revenge has given all sides more early defense, Allies get the Gaurdian GI's, Soviets get the Battle Bunkers and Yuri gets chaos drones. All of these help to stop early tank rushes. But RA2 is a totally different story.Online there are 2 basic RA2 stratagies, one basic Allied stratagy and one basic Soviet stratagy. You can usually tell what someone is going to do by the country he plays.The Soviets have the best basic tech level tank in the game, the Rhino tank. It is only $200 more expensive and slightly slower than the Allied Grizzly but it has much more armor and does more damage. So, sorry to say, most Soviet players, especially on small maps, will almost always rush with 4-6 Rhino tanks right off the bat. Some people will call this a cheap tactic, but there is a reason for this. The Allies don't have a very good arsenal of low tech units therefore making a quick Rhino rush hard to stop, but once the Allies get their Airforce Command and Battle Lab up they have a huge advantage over the Soviets. The Mirage and Prism tanks are deadly when used together, even with Apocolypse tanks a Soviet player usually stands no chance against a good Allied player with a mix of Mirages and Prisms. So as you can see, most games (for the most part) involve the Soviets trying to cripple or kill their opponent before they can build up the tech tree and get Prisms and Mirages while the Allied player is trying to hold off the Rhino attacks so they can get their Battle Lab up. This is just a generalization, but for the most part this is how RA2 games go.Yuri's Revenge on the other hand is a much different story, with the addition of the Yuri race and additional early defenses the games are a lot different.Anyway, depending upon the map and how much ore, gems and oil derricks are laying about, here are a few good basic build guidelines for RA2.Allied: Power plant, Barraks, Ore Refinary, Airforce Command, War Factory, Ore Refinary, Ore Refinary, Power Plant, Battle LabOnce you build your barraks make 4 dogs and send one to each corner of the map. If there are any tech buildings to capture build a dog to defend it while you train an engineer to go capture it. Build a pillbox or two to defend against any infantry that wanter into your base or to protect any oil derricks you capture. Once your Airforce Command is up build a few rocketeers to scout out the map and harrass anything that can't shoot back. First thing out of your war factory should be a mix of Grizzly Tanks and Chrono Miners, depending upon your financial situation at the time. You can sell your second or third refinary, you only needed them for the extra harvester. If you survive long enough to get your Battle Lab up be thankful, things get much easier for you after that. Use Mirages to stop the tank rushes and Prisms to take out infantry or base defenses. Don't rely on only one type, because they each have their weaknesses.Soviet: Power Plant, Barraks, Ore Refinary, War Factory, Power Plant, Ore Refinary, Ore Refinary, Radar, Power Plant, Battle Lab.Once you build your barraks make 4 dogs and send one to each corner of the map. If there are any tech buildings to capture build a dog to defend it while you train an engineer to go capture it. Build a sentry gun or two to defend against any infantry that wanter into your base or to protect any oil derricks you capture. Once your War Factory is built start pumping the Rhino tanks, if you don't have any gems or oil derricks it might be a good idea to build a War Miner or two first, but if you do have that extra income go straight for the tanks. Make sure to scout out your opponents base, and if it looks clear attack him once you get 4-6 Rhinos. If his base looks well defended take your tanks and go harrass any harvasters or oil derricks he has that arn't defended. You can sell your second or third refinary so that it doesn't take up too much power, you only really need one refinary, the reason you built it was so you could get a harvester without tying up your war factory build time. If you can make it into his base but don't kill him, assuming your economy is still going strong you can keep building Rhinos and keep sending attacks at him until you get your Battle Lab up. If the game lasts this long you could be in trouble, but if you have taken out enough harvesters or critical structures you will hopefully have enough of an advantage to eventually win.I hope that helps, just remember that these build orders are general, a lot of things depend upon the map. It will take some tweaking to make sure you don't run out of money halfway through. Sometimes you need to build more harvesters, sometimes you don't. Also, ALWAYS scout out your opponents base, if he isn't building anything to attack you, just build up your economy and tech tree!!! Capture oil derricks at all costs!!! They can turn the tide of any game! If you need any more specific advice just give me a holler. Also if any Yuri's Revenge players need some help I will gladly write up some ideas for you as well. It's not as hard as Starcraft, just play a few games online and eventually you will get better as you gain some experience. Good luck! <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> I prefer to tech up as the allies and start building the mirage and prisms whilst using the build and sell refinery ploy to get harvesters at the same time, all the time selling the refinery furthest from the ore and harvesting gems where possible. its all about having enough money to build all the time but not spending too much time building your economy that u are vulnerable to the rush tactic.I find alot of the time that a rushing soviet player will forget to defend his base with dogs and my first paradrop will be on his base if so otherwise defensive.Because you have the money early on build jets and rockies to hit the incoming rushers tanks then they will be damaged enough by the time they reach your base.Use a dog to scout the quickest path between your base and the soviet player, then you will know what is comeing at you.Once you have defeated the rush, attack whatever is most weakly defended his ore miners or his base. Mirages will rip through his ore miners and tanks and men and Terror drones, prisms will flatten his base in a second.You need to get him before HE techs up and gets kirovs/apoc which will force u to to buy more mirage tanks and lots of air defense.If he is iraq watch for the desolater... deployed, several of these things make a mess of your lightly armoured tanks not to mention your men. Kill them with jets.Libya have the demo truck so when you hear "my truck is loaded" hotkey to his base and nail that sucker with jets, if you can get it to go off in his base then View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_smile.gif if its near your base dont destroy it conventionally get it with a chrono guy then it will vanish rather than going nuclear.Russia have the tesla tank which isnt that good when you already have Rhinos and Apocs, better against men but one paradrop can kill one tesla tank easly. most soviet players dont play russian.If he's cuba then watch out for flack tracks full of terrorists or bombed conscripts these can be very bad, treat every flak as deadly and take it out with jets at range and the chrono guy if its closer.Spys and Secret Units.Barracks: Your infantry are trained as veterans.

<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> I find the british sniper to be a waste. a seal in an ifv will handle all of your infantry needs. Yes its a bit more expensive, but its worth it to have the paratroopers or grand cannon. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Prism tanks leave me underwhelmed, to be honest. A decent number (10-20) of GIs will wipe them out; move the GIs into range of the prisms, hit 'd' to deploy 'em, and wipe out the tanks one by one. The prisms have pisspoor armour, and, whilst you'll lose a few GIs when moving them in range, you shouldn't have any significant problems.And massed rocketeers kick anyone's ass.My feelings on Yuri's Revenge are mixed. His tanks bite. The genetic mutator is a fucking PITA if you have any infantry in your base. The gatling guns take too long to spin up to full speed.The Allied big crushing vehicle thingy is neat. Tank bunkers are a waste of time. Infantry bunkers are not.I was hoping for more stuff (along the lines of the stuff in RA2 DeeZire). And I rather want to have trenches.I was also hoping that some reason to play as anything other than the Americans might be given, but it hasn't been. Indeed, the incentive to use the Brits (the only competition, IMO) has been reduced, 'cos the SEAL makes the sniper a lot less special. It's gotta be allies, 'cos of the spy satellite and rocketeers. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Anyway, while most of what you say is true, as it currently stands Yuri's team is really broken. He can whipe out HUGE amounts of enemy tanks or infantry with only 1 or 2 Chaos drones. He has the best cheap defense tower, the Gattling Cannon, which shoots in the air and ground. He has the best naval unit, the boomer, which domintes with torpedos AND missiles. He has a sniper, the virus, which is better than the british sniper. He has the best early game derrick protector, the brute, which cannot be killed by dogs.Initiates are the best infantry when garrisoned into buildings.Initiates can also be placed into power plantes therefore giving Yuri a big speed advantage since he only needs one power plant for a long time.He has the best radar, it gives him pychic detection and the pychic reveal.He is the only team that can produce two heros. Yuri Prime can be cloned.Gatting tanks are not weak at all, they can kill infantry, planes, rocketeers, and terror drones VERY quickly. They can also destroy tanks that are being lifted with magnatrons. Don't forget Yuri Clones and Masterminds, when used correctly they don't just eliminate enemy threats but turn them into armies of your own.And most of all, his Slave miner only costs 1500, as opposed to the Soviet and Allied refinaries which are 2000, and it is even better since it can move to where the ore is and has more armor, plus a gun!All of these things add up to make Yuri the toughest team to beat. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Prism tanks + 20 Gi's == 20 dead GI's. NOt only do the prism's do splash damage, but they outrange the GI's, and kill instantly. They will torch any building you garrison the GI's in, and torch the infantry before they can get into another building.Maybe you just need to use more than one Peter. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Against massed prisms you need jets or heavy tanks (rhinos or Apocs) so always have enough ifvs and mirages mixed in and use the prisms long range to draw other units into the mirages or force them backwards.Its all about combos of units, a task force. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> He (Yuri) has the best radar, it gives him pychic detection and the pychic reveal. I disagree. While the Phychic detection is nice, the physic reveal sucks. For exploring the map in a hurry, dont' rely on your radar. For this one, I still have to give it to the allies. The Spy Satallite still rules in this regard. Everything else, i'm okay with.-Alpha <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> You misunderstand the (imho) correct use of the Psychic sensor, it is used to momentarily reveal the area under the Allies gap generators revealing whether he has thousands of prism tanks in there or not etc, its epescially usefull if he has more than one base. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> I was playing around a bit last night. I used Crazy Ivan to bomb 5 conscripts, loaded em into a flakvee and drove them to the opponents conyard. Undeploy, BOOOM! Funny stuff... More contained explosion than a bomb truck, also more concentrated I believe. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Prism tanks + 20 Gi's == 20 dead GI's.I meant per tank. And given that GIs are free, that's not a great deal to ask.quote:NOt only do the prism's do splash damage, but they outrange the GI's, and kill instantly. They will torch any building you garrison the GI's in, and torch the infantry before they can get into another building.Maybe you just need to use more than one Peter.View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_rolleyes.gifThe splash damage does very little when the GIs aren't coming in a tight bunch (well, for anything other than an elite PT, it does plain "very little" no matter what). The prisms take too long to "reload".It kinda irks me that you can *still* win with massed infantry. Sure, it's not as easy as it was in C&C (with the "selling a defensive structure" cheat), but you can still do it (unless the other person has deployed desolators ("It will be a silent spring!" View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif ) or enough snipers that they don't get overwhelmed). <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> All I can say is good luck having enough paradrops to have 20 GIs to every one of my prism tanks.I do agree with you though Infantry massed is very powerful.But then in reality one man with a LAW can take a Tank out.Id like a game like RA but with a little but more real units and tactics, yeah I know about Real War, dont get me started on that POS so much potential wasted. <br />

Yuri Prime is probably the least useless of all heroes, I'll give him that.quote:Gatting tanks are not weak at all, they can kill infantry, planes, rocketeers, and terror drones VERY quickly.Yeah, if you have enough of them that you can tolerate the loss of units whilst they're busy spinning up. Of course, even that doesn't help against planes, because the planes are long gone by the time the gattlings have reached a decent firing rate. And a decent sized army of rocketeers hasn't too much to worry about.quote:They can also destroy tanks that are being lifted with magnatrons.

The only real levellers are desolators, perhaps snipers/viruses, oh, and I forgot earlier, genetic mutators.quote:I do agree with you though Infantry massed is very powerful.But then in reality one man with a LAW can take a Tank out.Id like a game like RA but with a little but more real units and tactics, yeah I know about Real War, dont get me started on that POS so much potential wasted.I'm not sure how well it'd work. I have often thought it might be nice, but I dunno how well it'd work in practice. Tanks would be very vulnerable to men with rockets. They'd blow each other up in a single shot. Planes could blow up buildings with a single shot, but be killed with a single SAM -- but could blow up the SAM site without being detected. MLRSes could lay waste to men from a long way off. I think it'd end up being RA2 but with one-hit kills from everyone. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> The missiles are pretty good, I haven't seen the torpedos do much against mass dolphin attacks. Dolphins require a Battle Lab to build, Boomers only need a Radar, therefore there will be boomers attacking your naval yard before you even can get a chance to build dolphins.quote: British sniper outranges it; the gas stuff is nice an' all, but uselses if the british sniper has just killed you. True but you just said yourself that you only play America. Yuri ALWAYS gets viruses when only Britain gets snipers. The virus outranges the SEAL.quote: But I can still kill a building filled with initiates with a single chronotrooper. What does your single chronotrooper do when I undeploy them and you now are faced with 10 initiates?quote: Psychic reveal is meh. Psychic detection is nice, but nothing beats spy satellite. The Spy Satallite is the best, but it isn't the basic radar, its a high tech building. The Allied radar is the Airforce command, and Yuri's radar is better. As stated above one of the best uses is to use the psychic reveal to reveal gap generated areas quickly so you can target key buildings with boomers.quote: Do people really bother with heroes? Tanya's lost all reason to live now that SEALs are properly buildable units, and the Russian guy with his fucking laser aiming thing is a complete waste of time. Yuri Prime is probably the least useless of all heroes, I'll give him that. You forget that Tanya can place bombs on tanks now, as well is immune to being squished and mind controlled. This makes her MUCH better than the SEAL.quote: Yeah, if you have enough of them that you can tolerate the loss of units whilst they're busy spinning up. Of course, even that doesn't help against planes, because the planes are long gone by the time the gattlings have reached a decent firing rate. And a decent sized army of rocketeers hasn't too much to worry about. What are you talking about? 5 or 6 Gattling tanks can kill at least 4 planes or 20 rocketeers. Especially if we are in my base, which would probably have some Gattling cannons in it as well. Trust me, Yuri has the best Anti Air weapons.quote: Until I blow them away with my rocketeers. If you have so many rocketeers that you can kill mulitple gatlling cannons and tanks then you probably don't have enough ground force to keep you alive very long.quote: The gun is nice; the moving is sometimes nice. When it's walking about it's very vulnerable. Not really, it has the most armor of any harvester. It takes a lot of tanks (or rocketeers) to kill it before your opponent sends in forces to protect them.quote: IMO Yuri's best unit is the UFO. It's fun sitting one on top of a power plant. Oh yes, I forgot. The Disks can be very lethal. Once someone has 10+ disks its almost impossible to stop him.quote: I'm not sure how well it'd work. I have often thought it might be nice, but I dunno how well it'd work in practice. Tanks would be very vulnerable to men with rockets. They'd blow each other up in a single shot. Planes could blow up buildings with a single shot, but be killed with a single SAM -- but could blow up the SAM site without being detected. MLRSes could lay waste to men from a long way off. I think it'd end up being RA2 but with one-hit kills from everyone. Yeah, I agree. It's hard to think of RA2 as a realistic RTS, its more done in a comic book style. Either way I think its a good balance between fun and reality.Concerning the prism tank issue: Prism tanks are great, but if they arn't backed up by at least a FEW mirage tanks they will be whiped out by an equal number of Rhinos or Apocs. The prisms might get a few kills at first because of their superior range, but after the armored tanks get in close they prisms are toast. They take too long to reload and have too little armor. They are best for taking out bases and infantry, not being the main battle tank in the allied army.Funny how as soon as people in this thread began arguing it took off. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> quote:Originally posted by Wudan Master:You misunderstand the (imho) correct use of the Psychic sensor, it is used to momentarily reveal the area under the Allies gap generators revealing whether he has thousands of prism tanks in there or not etc, its epescially usefull if he has more than one base.While I agree that can be useful, you've also just reminded me of another very good reason to play Allies - the Gap Generator.The other teams just don't have the advantage of both revealing all of the map AND hiding their little piece of it. A very powerful combination....Plus, if you station a few Guardian GIs strategically, spy planes will never reach your base. The psychic reveal is good for a quick glimpse, but it's just not as useful to me as being able to look again in just a few minutes to see if anything at the location has changed. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> I have to say, you've made several statements that my experiences just don't support.The more men you have, in fact, the better the prism tank will be. The kills are instant, and the beam refracts and does damage over an area. It moves slowly, but you can roll it away, and most importantly, the more infantry it kills, the faster it gains rank. An elite prism tank is a force to be reckoned with by anyone's standards.As for that many rocketeers.. at 600 a pop, if you're building them and I'm building grizzlies, you're massed rocketeers are gonna leave your base toast. Rocketeers simply can't kill fast enough to stop tanks en mass, and more importantly, nothing stops me from using guardian GI's at 200 a pop or IFV's or rocketeers to kill your own rocketeers.The gatling cannong takes out aircraft very quickly, and at 1200 each, harriers getting lost often cost more than the target they're destroying. Aircraft carriers, on the other hand...If you haven't played people online or at a LAN, you're going to be in for a rude awakening when you do. The AI, no matter how good, is relatively dumb, even as far as RTS AI's go. Even on brutal they're relatively easy to defeat.I agree with you, the American Side really is the best, because it gets free units. However, Yuri's not the pushover that is made out.. in fact, I think the gattling cannon is TOO powerful. And the patch just makes it worse. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Dont get me wrong Vampyre i'm a U.S.A. player as well, the paradrops are just too nice.I go allies for these reasons.Spy sat + gap gen + Chrono guys.With the chrono guys and the full map, when crates are on I will have nearly every crate and once i get a yuri or soviets MCV the combos are hard to beat.and not to forget all the extra cash. <br />
<img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> quote: Dolphins require a Battle Lab to build, Boomers only need a Radar, therefore there will be boomers attacking your naval yard before you even can get a chance to build dolphins.That's certainly true (I rarely, if ever, play maps with lots of water, the naval units don't really do it for me).quote:True but you just said yourself that you only play America. Yuri ALWAYS gets viruses when only Britain gets snipers. The virus outranges the SEAL.The virus doesn't shoot quite fast enough (IMO) to make it effective against being swarmed. They seem most useful for harrassing other Yuri harvesters.quote:What does your single chronotrooper do when I undeploy them and you now are faced with 10 initiates?I didn't think you could undeploy when the building was being chronoshifted. Assuming you'd notice (you don't get a "your base is under attack" alert when someone does this, nor do you get a little red box on the radar screen).quote:The Spy Satallite is the best, but it isn't the basic radar, its a high tech building. The Allied radar is the Airforce command, and Yuri's radar is better. As stated above one of the best uses is to use the psychic reveal to reveal gap generated areas quickly so you can target key buildings with boomers.If you have naval units, which I don't much care for.quote:You forget that Tanya can place bombs on tanks now,But she can't shoot whilst approaching that tank. The Allied crusher thingies will make short work of her (with the SEAL or whoever you've put inside it), gattling tanks can mow down infantry reasonably fast. The Soviets have a problem in this area (I think).quote:as well is immune to being squished and mind controlled. This makes her MUCH better than the SEAL.Having one unmindcontrollable unit doesn't really excite me all that much. If you could build a whole bunch of Tanyas, that would be neat.quote:What are you talking about? 5 or 6 Gattling tanks can kill at least 4 planes or 20 rocketeers.Whoever uses only 4 planes?quote:Especially if we are in my base, which would probably have some Gattling cannons in it as well. Trust me, Yuri has the best Anti Air weapons.I think that a bunch of elite rocketeers are the best AA weapons.quote:If you have so many rocketeers that you can kill mulitple gatlling cannons and tanks then you probably don't have enough ground force to keep you alive very long.Well, perhaps. That remains to be seen. Rocketeers are very useful, because they can't be mind controlled and they can't be mutated. They're at risk from gattling cannons but, if memory serves, that's about all.quote:Not really, it has the most armor of any harvester.And it's also the slowest.quote:It takes a lot of tanks (or rocketeers) to kill it before your opponent sends in forces to protect them.Kill them, too.quote:Oh yes, I forgot. The Disks can be very lethal. Once someone has 10+ disks its almost impossible to stop him.Yes, indeed. Their lasers are quite weak, but because they can turn off your power, they can normally afford to take their time. <br />

              <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> "<u>-=Turtle=-</u> is a tactic that emphasizes heavy defense. It consists of defense building and some ranged units. It holds off rushes, but is not cost effective against boom, since the Boomer could get better economy to build stronger offensive strategies. | A <u>-=boom=-</u> in RTS games is the faster economy build up. The goal of the boom is to outperform the opponents economically. This will enable faster epoch advancements, better unit improvements and the ability to build stronger armies. Due to the need to first build up a booming economy, however, military buildup is delayed, making a booming player vulnerable to rushes. But they can outperform turtler in term of economy. | A <u>-=Rush=-</u> is one of three basic strategies in RTS games like Empire Earth. Goal of a Rush is to strike the opponent early in the game with military units. Those military strikes do not necessarily have the goal of total annihilation as early military units often lack the power to do so. Most rushes consist of small groups of military units, which are sent to the opponents base to kill Citizens and/or destroy resource drop-offs.; Basic Strategy: To rush an opponent, several key elements come into play: Early scouting: To rush an opponent, you have to know where he is and where his Citizens are, so early scouting is needed. The downside is, that if the opponent sees your scouting unit, it might tip him off to expect a rush.; Weakened economy: A rushing player will have to make compromises in terms of his economic buildup. While it is best to invest in food and wood gathering to start up the economy, a rushing player has to divert gatherers to iron or gold gathering early, because these are required for military units.; Since military units are scarce in the early games, a rusher might find himself rushed by another opponent, unable to react due to the weakened economy.; Rushes in Empire Earth: Due to the exaggeratedly cheating AI, rushing can not be applied by human players against the AI in Random Map Games. The AI players, however, will usually rush the human player. Rushes can be employed in Multiplayer games or against the AI in scenarios, if the AI cheating has been disabled in those. | <u>-=AI Cheat=-:</u> An AI cheat is an advantage given to the AI players to offset the lack of improvising talent and intelligence, which puts the human player at a disadvantage. The AI in Random Map Games cheats massively, which makes it virtually impossible for any but the most experienced human players to beat the AI in a land-based game. The AI employs several key cheats; Unlimited Resources: Symptoms: AI players have virtually no need to gather Resources as they are provided unlimited resources for free. This means that it is impossible to starve an AI opponent off resources. Therefore, a key element in RTS warfare is only available when playing against human opponents.; Testing: This can be proven by raiding an AI's base until only one Town Center or Capitol remains. A small military force waits in front of the building and kills every Citizens immediately after it has been trained. Even though the AI has no longer any resource gathering citizen, it will never run out of food and will perpetually train citizen. Acceleration Effect: Symptoms: AI players can train units and build structures in a fraction of the time it takes the human player. A single citizen, for instance, can rebuild a Tower quicker than a fully upgraded battle ship can take it down. During a massive raid of an AI base by a human players force, the AI player can rebuild important military buildings almost instantly if only a single citizen survives; Testing: Start a Random Map Game with an AI opponent and an AI ally. Assign yourself 20 Citizen at the start, one each to the AI players. In the time the human player manages to create 5 additional citizen, the AI ally will have created at least 10, built several buildings and trained several military units. On Island games, the computer will have built at least 3 towers as well, which is nigh-on impossible for the human player in the same time.; Magic Eye: Symptoms: The AI players are not hampered by the fog of war. The AI can perform detailed terrain analysis of the human players base despite the fog of war. It can even see University, Hospital and Temple ranges, enabling it to exploit even the smallest gaps in the human player's defenses.; Testing: Start a Random Map Game on a 'Large Islands' map. Surround your island with towers, protecting all but one with temples. The AI opponent will go straight for the single unprotected tower and flatten it with an Earthquake, even though it never scouted your base.; Defending against AI cheating: The easiest defense against AI cheating is to play custom scenarios in which the AI cheating has been disabled. It may be worth noting however, that the exaggerated AI cheating has seemingly been introduced to offset the generally poor quality of the Empire Earth AI. AI players, who cannot employ aforementioned cheats will be ridiculously easy to beat.; While it is generally extremely hard to with withstand the attacks of AI players, who can build huge armies in mere minutes, there are some options to beat an AI player, for instance in Large Islands Random Map Games." &mdash;Excerpt | <a href="https://empireearth.fandom.com/wiki/Guides">Tips Guides</a> | <a href="http://www.cheatbook.de/wfiles/empireearthstrat.htm">EE Strategies</a> | <a href="https://www.gamerstemple.com/games/000044/000044t00.asp">EE Tips</a> | <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/04/empire-earth-multiplayer-strategiesfaq-597675">Multiplayer Strategies</a> | <a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Empire_Earth">Tuts &amp; Walkthrough</a> | <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/376328-empire-earth/faqs">GameFAQs Guides</a> | <a href="https://ee.heavengames.com/new/eeh/strategies/viewarticle.php?id=83">EE Guide HeavenGames</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/ep0BAJwZ#Q6Kou5lBX5nL_s5Qns5_tIN_mAWPFer5HKjvATtcfzE">EE Tech Tree.xls (AOC)</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/Ct9QGD5Z#tbKfEfTseu3yh4i_t8b2HmNbvPW0KjopMPH1H-i3vN8">Empire Earth - Manual - PC.pdf</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/PxdllTjY#0eFgdbmqn8WepxDVuPTRXyRXl2I0kJ28XU9biDIhq0E">eEE-AoC - Prima Official eGuide.pdf</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/jg9WxCCI#8KcK_qZ4DO26PfwK6r4TEKKyvKqb-bZ-2r8g21Kp_O8">Empire Earth - The Art of Conquest.pdf (Manual)</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/GhMDHICR#5fQwH0fO7FXbiNOERmkOPLxGG359mN02q9hyb1KQQ14">Empire Earth - TECHNOLOGY TREE.pdf</a> | <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/561395-empire-earth-the-art-of-conquest/faqs/57107">Strategy Guide by _0blivion_</a> | <a href="https://archive.org/details/Empire_Earth_Empire_Earth_The_Art_of_Conquest_Prima_Official_eGuide">Prima Official eGuide</a> | <a href="https://empireearth.eu/download/">EE-AOC Download Page</a><br />

              <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Five Keys to Success: <b>#</b>1. Attack! Attack! Attack! Most people never attack soon enough which is a hindrance to you and your team. The more aggressive you are, the better chances you are at winning <b>#</b>2. Play Defensively as well as offensively. Use every defensive method you can think of. Use towers, walls, houses and even your buildings for making your base economy free. One thing that you should be aware of is your base formation. Don't make everything so close together. This could hinder microing later on. Make your base like a sive, so you can "weave" the enemy out. <b>#</b>3. Keep popped at all times. Never stop making citizens or units. Make sure to be at the very peak of your popping point at all times. Use fortresses for storing up some units for later on, pop some settlements to be town centers. Do anything it takes to be on top of everyone's economy. <b>#</b>4. Counter units. One of the great things about Empire Earth is the large variety of units and their upgrades. Many people will just mass units because it wins that game easily. This can be a hindrance to yourself if another player has your counter. Using the right type of units can win you almost any battle. <b>#</b>5. Micromanagement. This is probably the most important point. If you can learn how to micro well, you will be the victor in most games. Microing not only takes speed, but a patient player. Don't just run into your enemies hands, make him chase you, lead him where you want him to be. I encourage those with a low PS to get to know your hotkeys well. It would be a great advantage for you. Speed wins the game.<br />
              <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Tactics:: <b>#</b>The Walls: Finally, if forest and/or mountains surround you, passages leading to your camp should be quite narrow: in that case, it can be very efficient to put wall in those passages. But watch out! Do not completely surround yourself with walls, because in that case, it would be very easy to siege your town and your economical development would become very difficult as you won&#8217;t be able to go out from your city et conquer the map. In anyway, defense using a wall bring your expansion potential down. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>#</b>-Speed: <u><b>#</b>This is extremely important</u> to micromanage properly your units at the same time as expending your economy. To do so, it is vital to use hotkeys (H, D, C, S, E etc&#8230; see user manual pour the full list of hotkeys). Do not forget that using hotkeys is suppose to gain time, so if you have to constantly look at your keyboard, it is doubtful that the speed increase will be great . <u><b>#</b>If you feel that you</u> are overwhelmed and that there are too many things to do, it&#8217;s mean that you are not fast enough compared to your playing level. However, if you feel that all what you wanted done is done but there are no blank, that&#8217;s mean that your speed is balanced with your level, therefore no problem J . <u><b>#</b>Finally, if there are blank</u> moments in a game, it&#8217;s mean there is a problem somewhere (except game speed normal or slow lol): indeed, there are always things to do in EE; move your dog, continue creating peons (HCHCHC), use all your resources, (more farms if wood excess, boom with food excess, etc&#8230; <u><b>#</b>You should always try</u> to be active, once you succeed into that, try each following game to be faster doing the same things so you can improve your level (if speed does not make you progress, you will need sufficient speed in order to progress) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>#</b>Managing your army: <u><b>#</b>A basic control is</u> the use of "ctrl + right click", so your troopers will reach the chosen point attacking everything on their way. <u><b>#</b>Each group is named</u> (ctrl 1, ctrl 2 etc&#8230;you come back to each group by pressing 1,2 etc&#8230;. <u><b>#</b>If you are using those</u> groups for a massive attack, ideally you should then separate each units types into different groups (for instances: group 1 archers, group 2 pike man etc&#8230; <u><b>#</b>However is you need</u> to hassle your opponent, it would be best to just mix them (or mix all the units with the same speed together, there is nothing more frustrating that loosing half of your army while the other half is still on the way) <b>#</b><u>Regarding the hassling part</u>, personally I am using maximum 3 groups, 1 main group with 80% of my army, 2 others with 10% each. The 2 small groups should attack constantly one after another. You need to surprise the opponent where he won&#8217;t expect you, or where the defenses are down. For example, the 1st group is going to attack at the top of the enemy base, generally, even if you surprise him at that point, this attack should not do a lot of damage as your opponent is going to react very fast by sending all his army there. Of course, this is the second attack which is suppose to do a lot of damage, by attacking at the bottom of the enemy camp, where the enemy army is missing in action . During that time, the first group (which you asked to flee the battle), could for instance, come back by behind. When you feel that your opponent is getting disorganize, send the main of your army through the front of the camp, where you did not conduct any attack yet. <b>#</b>Doing those attack is very important: <u><b>#</b>- Weakened the enemy</u> <u><b>#</b>- Push him into defense</u> and stop him to attack you <u><b>#</b>- Disorganize him et</u> mess him up: he does not know anymore where you are going to attack and will try to defend everything all together: this is exactly what you want as, like Caesar use to say "Dividing to Rule", and then the main attack will be much easier. <u><b>#</b>- You will always know</u> what he is doing, where are his best spots etc&#8230; <u><b>#</b>However, if the enemy</u> camp is too well defended, or if your army does not have range units, you could loose more than him...so hassling is not always the best solution. <u><b>#</b>During a large attack</u>, do not forget your production, economic as well as military, and also, place the rally point of barrack, factories etc quite close to the action. If you have to go back, do not forget to remove those rally points and bring back the units that were on the way. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>#</b>Scouting procedure: <u><b>#</b>Always start your game</u> by creating a dog, even before starting your citizens. <b>#</b>Scouting is very important whatever game it is; this is the scout that will allow you to organize your defense and your attack as explained in above chapter. It will allow you to discover your camp as well as the enemy one, to evaluate the enemy choices (in terms of army, rushing attitude or booming attitude, his defense (tower localization or houses)). <b>#</b>To use the scout properly: <u><b>#</b>First explore your camp</u> in circles, to find your food (forage, hippo, hunt place), your forest, and your mines, your camp configuration (surrounding hills, places, et access possibilities). Following to that, try to find as soon as possible the enemy camp, explore as best as possible, by avoiding the peon concentration that might kill your dog, your minimum discoveries should be what mine is he using, and what military building is he constructing, in order to guess what units is he going to produce. After that, you&#8217;ll need to find out the same information that in your own camp, food sources, mines, forest and hills. Once you do have all those information, you should be able to adapt your strategies according to his weaknesses. <u><b>#</b>Do not forget to</u> have your dog always active, have him circling the enemy camp in quite large circles (in order to see any expansion, and he won&#8217;t be killed by the first military units). During long games, it is almost a must to produce another dog to explore others part of the map. <u><b>#</b>At ages 9 and 10</u>, do not forget that you have a balloon, having a safe spot of exploration as long as the enemy does not have anti aerial units. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>#</b>The 2 extremes rush/boom are: <u><b>#</b>-A rush</u> super fast without producing any peons at all, betting on the fact that the opponent won&#8217;t have any military units or tower yet <u><b>#</b>-A full boom</u>, using all your food to produce peons without any military units before 10/15 min and to get a good economy | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>-=Army diversity and upgrades:=-</u> <u><b>#</b>Looking at the units</u> you use, you need at least 2 kinds of different units (in a way that some are piercing, and the other one shock for example). Ideally, having one type of fast moving unit (for hassling and to more easily control the enemy army) and/or a range unit (to benefit from hills bonuses, and further more, to avoid having all your close contact units getting of the way of each other). <b>#</b>You should know as well that long-range units are way more efficient when produced massively. A mass archer, especially with a hero warrior, would be very hard to handle even with cavalries or shock infantries. <u><b>#</b>Regarding the upgrades</u>, if this is a close combat unit, look at upgrading the speed (if those units are cavalries or pike men&#8217;s, improve speed only if the gain if +2 minimum, otherwise it won&#8217;t be much of a benefit), the armor (at least to the first level as it is cheap), attack and hit points only when you start having quite a number of units to really feel the benefits. <u><b>#</b>For range units</u>, the most important is to increase the range, first of all, it will make your hassling easier to handle, and also they will kill a lot more units before being attacked (especially if the enemy units is composed of close combat units). Next would be attack upgrade, quite important, but then again only when your army is quite big. I won&#8217;t recommend the armor upgrade, even though it is not expensive, it is not really efficient, and you won&#8217;t be able to upgrade the hit points (the order of those upgrade should then be: range, attack, hit points, range, attack)<br />
              <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> Introduction to Pre2Space (Not Planets): Pre2Space (P2S), has been a favorite setting for many years. This setting takes speed and right techniques to boom or rush your way into victory. The first epoch you start out in is "Prehistoric." In <u>-=Prehistoric=-,</u> the gather rate is slow and the unit's don't come in a wide variety. The best of players will be seen clubbing their way through the enemy as well as saving up for epoching. The main strategy for P2S Plains is Wing will go clubs and the Pocket will either go Clubs/Spear or even Archers. As in most cases, the wing must rush and the pocket will boom. The key epochs that one must achieve to aid him or the team are as follows: Copper, Bronze, Renaissance, WW1 and Space. <u>-=Copper=-</u> - Contains farms. With farms you are no longer constrained to foraging and hunting <u>-=Bronze=-</u> - One is able to get siege aiding him in taking out any unwanted buildings or towers. <u>-=Renaissance=-</u> - The use of ranged infantry come into place <u>-=WW1=-</u> - Allows one to get tanks and air. If a player gets air while all others are in an epoch which does not allow any anti-air units, they are as good as dead. <u>-=Space=-</u> - A wide variety of robots/cyborgs are at use. Also, the farms are able to gather food by themselves.<br />
              <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> #Different strategies depending on the ages: Except stated otherwise, the following strategies will use Austria civ, and are mainly for 1v1 on a small map <u>-=Age 1: Prehistory:=-</u> At this age, harvesting food can only be done by hunting and forage, it is therefore very important to properly control and defend the food spots -The most classical strategies: pikeman rush: quick change of age at about 7min30, than production in a barrack. Do not forget to quickly upgrade speed and attack at least. This strategy is completely based on hassling the opponent. After a while, you must rapidly start slingers, and then upgrade age 3 (latest at 22-23min) to get the bows -Mass pikeman: going to age 2 will be a little bit later, but military production happen in 2 or even 3 barracks. To do so, assign a lot more peon on wood before going to era 2, and then, when the barrack are done, assign those peons on hunting (you&#8217;ll need to have enough wood for another settlement beside hunting ground). This strategy is possible only if hunting is near and quite massive. Here again, it is a must to upgrade speed and attack. Do not produce bows and save your gold to go age 3, and then produce cav to counter the enemy archers that your opponent will have done for sure. You will also need to build some farms to ensure continuous production of peons, pikeman and cav. -Boom + slingers: here again, you will need enough hunt to do this strategy, because even if you do have enough to produce continuously from2 TC, you will still need 375 Food to go to era 3. This strategies is based on a slinger mass and then, quite fast, bows. Houses will do your defense, and that will allow a good defense (especially against maceman which are such peon killers). The attacks will happen at age 3 with bows, rapidly supported by cavalries. NB: a variant of this strategy is to take the Assyrian Empire to get their speed and range bonus on bows. The strategy is then totally different: the 1st one is based on a boom; this one is based on hassling, without booming, helped by greater speed and range from the bows. -Peon rush: this strategy targets the enemy forage. First of all, you must be sure that your enemy did not build houses or a tower on the food spot. The attack needs to be done exactly at the moment where the opponent is going age 2, so his economy will be the lowest. The principle is to take all your peons at F11 6:30-7:30 et send them on enemy forage: in theory, the enemy peons should flee to regroup and fight, at this time, you must build a tower next to the forage. You will then do a settlement and start harvesting the forage and exploit his camp. During that time, continue to produce peons in your base, and go through age 2 at about 13/15 min. Even if it seem quite late, you will normally weakened your opponent so much, that you will be in a stronghold position on his own ground, and your economy will be 2-3 times stronger that his. <u>-=Age 2: Stone Age:=-</u> Possible strategies are the same than age 1, except that rush pikeman is more efficient and the slinger boom is more risky due to earlier battles. -Fast age3 followed by rush cav: this strategy is possible only if your opponent is doing slingers, you will require a very good scooting to ensure and consolidate your strategies. <u>-=Age 3: Copper Age:=-</u> Bow mass isn&#8217;t really valid anymore at this age as the 2 other military building (stable and barrack) provide bow-counter. Leaving 3 strategies possibilities: -Rush pikeman (Do not hesitate to produce in mass if your opponent choose bows) -Rush Cav, even against an opponent producing pikeman, cav rush is playable as long as you hassle properly using the speed advantage. The goal in that case is to kill as much peons as possible while avoiding the enemy army -Mass pikeman then fast age 4: goal being to go to age 4 fast, to upgrade pikeman to Phalanx and start producing Cav archers <u>-=Age 4: Bronze Age:=-</u> At this age, there are 2 main strategies, rush cav archers with Assyrien Empire or defense with cavalries then fast age 5 with Austria -Rush cav archers: the advantage of this strategy is to be able to hassle very easily using the high speed and range of cav archers. If your opponent does the same, the game will be a mass cav archers production (with upgrades as fast as possible), a very good micro management of the units, and a very good hassling. If your opponent does cavalries, you must imperatively hassle him as much as possible, the most important being not to leave any access to iron, so he won&#8217;t be able to go to age 5. You must absolutely go to age 5 before him, to obtain the Persian cav to counter his cav, If you fail to do so, he will upgrade his cav to cataphractes, you can be certain to loose the game, as cataphractes are deadly against cav archers and peons (5 cataphractes upgraded (1 up attack, 1 up anti pierce, 1 up hit points) can kill at least 15 cav archers up at 10) -Fast age 5 cavalries: this strategy is meant to counter the mass cav archers. The principle is to produce few cavalries in defense to limits rush possibilities, and go to age 5 as fast as possible to get the cataphractes. If your enemy is making cavalries, in that case, the best solution is to rapidly create 2 elephants, as the only counter for them are archers, and if luckily (for you ) your enemy attack you with his peons, because of his foot area effect you may be able to kill up to 15 peons with 4-5 shots. Further more, elephants are very efficient in destroying buildings (2 elephants are enough to destroy 1 tower) NB: I won&#8217;t recommend the inf rush, short sword or Phalanx because if your opponent is doing cav, the elephants are deadly to inf, and if he is producing cav archers, their speed is so high that they can face almost anything with good micro management (and some Javelin in support) <u>-=Age 5: Dark Age:=-</u> At this age, you have the choice between classical devellopement, starting with Persian cavalries and going to cav archers quite fast with Assyrian Empire, or do a very fast rush Persians cav with England. -Persians cavalries followed but cav archers: if your opponent does the same, it will often be the best micro manager the winner. If he starts by cav archers, you stop Persian cav and start cataphractes. -Very fast Persian cavalry rush with England: this can be done only if you locate a gold mine very fast. The goal of this strategy is to stop producing peon to get enough food to produce Persian cav very fast. Here you will benefit from England bonuses, building cheaper, gold harvest faster, and ranged cav cheaper. To use this strategy, you do not do any settlement to gain speed at the beginning (even if you loose some economical power). I do not know any strategies that demand more micro management and focus on a game, at least, when the opponent resist to the first rush. <u>-=Age 6: Middles ages:=-</u> At this age there are 2 min strategies possible: mass cav archers with Assyrian empire (in 99% of the case), and long sword rush followed by cav archers with Byzantine Rome. -Mass cav archers: The principle is exactly the same as mass in age 4. NB: I advise you to be extra careful into going to age 7, against a player using all his resources and hassling you to a maximum, going age 7 means surely defeated. - Long sword rush: the goal of this strategy isn&#8217;t to kill his army (way too fast for inf to follow), but to kill his peons. You must weaken his economy before producing cav archers. NB: Anti pierce upgrade for long sword are very efficient (6+5 when 2 ups) <u>-=Age 7: Renaissance:=-</u> At this age, if in a short term a couple of combos are possible, on the long run, there are not really further choices. Short term, you may find inf+pikeman, cav+carabineers. The only efficient combo on long term is cav+inf (+some carabineers). -Rush inf: Classic stuff, but always efficient if you scoot properly and react on time if you see cav in front of you. If your opponent is taking gold, create fast 3 or 4 pikemans (with some inf still) and up their speed to ease the micro management toward cav/carabineers. In order to slow down the enemy economy, it can be very good to kill his hunt, as producing cav without hunt becomes really hard. You should do the same to someone booming with cav. Against an inf rush, it is often the best hassle and/or the fastest to add cav to his army that end up winning. Last important point is that you must find the opponent base very fast...its look obvious, but it is really the crucial point of this strategy (like most rush in fact) because if your enemy choose to boom+inf, you must arrive in his base before he can produce any inf at all, or, having a better economy, he will overpower you by producing in a couple of barracks. -Rush cav: against another rush cav, you&#8217;ll need to produce only carabineers, and then quickly change your production line to do inf. Against a rush inf, the best solution is to do a majority of cav along with few carabineers (those have to kill the pikemens). Against a boom, you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems because hassling will be quite easy. Still you will have to think about producing inf to kill the inevitable pikemens or carabineers. -Boom: Only if you have hunting ground near by! If you choose to start with inf, you should play in defense until you have some cav. However, if you start by cav, that will allow you to hassle the enemy camp, therefore allow you to develop your side quietly, you will then be more focus on the attack. -Very fast rush cav: principle being the same as very fast Persian cav in Age 5, this can be done only if you actually stop your peon production and find a gold mine very fast. You can do that with Frank&#8217;s civ. <u>-=Age 8: Imperial Age:=-</u> The units here are the same as in age 7 except for the ranged infantries and pikemens (whatever are their name ), which are much better while cav, remains the same. The strategies therefore remain identical except that cav strategies are not efficient any more. Effectively, against a cav combo cav + carabineers (the one efficient at age 7) the new pikemens with speed up are efficient enough (+ very deadly against peons). Here you have the choice between boom+inf (with Austria), rush inf (Austria or Kingdom of Italy) or just a classical development (but slow) with Spain (Spain having the best bonuses of the game for inf, but doesn&#8217;t have bonus on peons nor on hunting&#8230; Either ways, if you principal army is made of inf, it can be good to include some Elite guard (however, do no do an army of them as they are being trashed by cav). After a while in the game, you must include some cav with your inf. Another interesting strategy, well, if you find the enemy base fast enough, is to do a rush with 2/3 pikemens (not more, because after it is better to produce musketeers)..If you arrive in the enemy base while he doesn&#8217;t have any inf yet, you almost guaranteed the victory for yourself, however, against inf that is worthless <u>-=Age 9: Industrial age:=-</u> Here again the strategies are the same as age 7, the difference being that booming is much easier. I advise you to be careful into going age 10, there are no longer anti cavalries at this age, so a piece of advice, do some cav and/or carabineers before going into age 10&#8230;otherwise only tanks and planes can kill cav and both of them are quite costly and slow to produce. Against somebody going into age 10 while you are still at age 9, you should produce quite a lot of cav, but also some canons (theses are the only unite from age 9 (with carabineers) efficient against tanks) <u>-=Age 10: WW1:=-</u> Here again nothing really original&#8230;boom and rush inf are largely in use. This rush inf is particularly efficient, along with AC and then artilleries. The power of the units start to really become important, and it is more and more important to upgrade the range. -Rush inf: I would emphasize that if your opponent plays defense with Machine gun, you&#8217;ll have 2 choices, or you up the range of your inf +2 and with some micro management, you should be able to kill machine gun, or you do a factory and start producing tanks (but in small quantities if possible&#8230;mass tanks require a lot of resources and are easy to counter). If you see some tanks, stop directly mining iron and switch to a gold mine (even 2 for security) and start to produce grenade launchers, waiting to have enough wood to create a siege factory for AC. -Rush Tank: this one can be very efficient if instead of building your tank factory in your camp, you build it in the middle of the map so it will be hidden from your enemy. However, this rush is double sided, due to cost of factory itself and tanks thereafter, it becomes quite hard to change your production later on. -Boom: with Austria, and in that case, you will be fast enough, and start producing inf+AC or tanks (if you scooted a rush inf in your enemy. You can also take Great Britain to get a tower range bonus (best defense against a rush) and bonus on gold (in barracks, there are counters to all other units at age 10 :anti-inf=machine gun and anti tanks=grenade launchers. Those 2 units demands gold, and at the siege factory, AC also require gold and has more attack, hit points and speed with great Britain. The main problem with those units is that they are counter units and not attacking units. Great Britain is then very good if you play defensive style. <u>-=Age 11: WW2:=-</u> Units are the same as age 10 except the fact that they are all much better (not AC). Rush inf or rush tank are therefore more efficient, and boom is more risky. Keep this in mind, but the strategies are the same as WW1. <u>-=Age 12: Modern Age:=-</u> At this age, again, the units are identical as the one in age 11, except AC have evolved (Tank rush are more risky now) and planes, which prior to this age are too easy to counter, become now very powerful. So if the strategies are still the same, now you can add the air rush (or air boom, as planes to not require food) Furthermore, food (and wood) is being collected faster than age 11, so boom is easier. -Air rush or Air boom: if it seems that United States is the best for that, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend that choice because their economy is good only for minerals, and you will be immediately spotted as doing Air attack (maybe a tank rush&#8230;. It is safer a more flexible civ such as Great Britain. Once the Air rush is done, if your opponent isn&#8217;t dead, you must add a ground army, because an army based on one type of units only won&#8217;t last long. <u>-=Age 13: Digital Age:=-</u> Here power and range of all unit increases again. As well to help out your defense, tower range increases. Cyber appear at that age. Previous strategies are still valid, and one more strategy appears: rush tempest Air rush becomes less efficient due to increase in AA power. -Rush Tempest (+Apollo): Take Novaya Russia to get cyber bonuses (Hit points, speed and tempest/Apollo cheaper). The goal is to kill enemy peons (in on shot only!!! So look at the hassling possibility, with his 21 point of speed&#8230; and not killing enemy army. However, tempests are strong against any small ground army (except AC) due to his special powers. Precisely, if Apollo is curing him and gives him a shield, Tempest becomes almost invulnerable for a short period. Do not forget not to stick too long to this combo; you should turn to a more classical army as Tempest becomes obsolete if the opponent army is too large (as Tempest is a close range unit). <u>-=Age 14: Nano Age:=-</u> Here again all the units are more powerful, Food and wood is gathered much faster to facilitate booming. Rush at Nano age becomes difficult, except if you put a tower in attack (range at 10 with great Britain!) and play with less common units (tanks, cyber ect..) to surprise your opponent. The 3 TC boom becomes very much possible but remain risky. Gathering Resources is so fast at this age that micro management of units and development becomes quite tuff.<br />

Take Grigor and Pytorr on Pytorr's car and head northeast to find a farm. Beside the farm you will find a potato truck, the truck is yours, get in and go to Voldograd ( you are pretty safe when you passing the gate). When you get to voldograd, you will talk to a officer and the city is yours. Now make 2 diplomats. Send each to other cities's fortress except Ukraine and Vorenzh. While your diplomats are going to other cities, make bunch of citizens. Put 6 on iron, 6 on gold, 5 on stone, make a granary and put 8 citizens on farm, for wood 5 are enough. Now start making a wall so that it covers whole of your base (Do not forget to build towers beside the wall, you must make two or three towers with the gate and two or three at some other place). I suggest that you put 4 or 5 citizens on wall. Your diplomats must have reached the cities (ignore any attack that the city armies make on your diplomats). They will demand 1000 iron and 1000 gold from you. Tribute them gold and iron. When you ally with these two cities, Ukraine will ally automatically. Now prepare some defences, make some tanks and some soldiers (I suggest that you must not make Trench Mortar). Scatter your base with AA guns. Make a gate in between your wall where there is road.; Once you have enough money, upgrade into the digital age,; this is a much needed upgrade.Be sure to make an airport or two. Now start making titan bombers(first you have to upgrade B-52 bombers), make about 3 or 4.Make them fly and upgrade their hp, attack and flight time.By this time in the game Ukraine probably have already blew up Vorenzh's AA guns, if not blow them up yourself, or send a flare there. (You better send a flare) It's at the west side of the city; the wall there should have zero AA. (It does not matter if the Capitol have some AA guns as you have 3,4 bombers). Now send your Titan bombers to their capitol. One of your titan bomber will surely reach their capitol and bomb it.

While the airport is producing titan bombers make many citizens and put 6 on gold, 6 on iron, 6 on stone, 5 on food and start making a wall so that it covers your whole base (Wall is very important because british troops come and attck you time after time and also do not forget to build towers with your wall, they are very important). Put 4,5 citizens on wall. Also start getting wood as it is important for AA guns. Now scatter your base with AA guns. Your titan bombers must have been completed make them fly and quickly send them to Ukraine's capitol and blow it up. (You have to make an agressive move because they do not prepare their defences too early, same is the case with western allies). While your titan bombers are going to Ukraine upgrade their attack, hp and speed (Upgrade more attack and hp than speed). When Ukraine is defeated a doctor guy will come and now you can make cyber factories and laboritries. Now prepare some defences, make some tanks, some black robes and some cybers(Ares).; Now start making more Titan Bombers make 4(If any of the Titan Bomber is left from Ukraine, then make 3). If any one attack defend it with your troops and towers(upgrade towers and AA guns range, hp and attack). Now when your Titan Bombers are produced take them together to Western Allies capitol and blow it up. Now you are almost done. Your one or two Titan Bombers must have return safely, if not then make so that you have two titan bombers.

Throw in a strategist hero for healing perposes too, just for juck. Youll also scare the hell out of an online enemy using this tactic; the last thing they'd expect is their big tank column being cut to ribbons by people on horseback bearing swords; Other tips:; Zeus cybers are good at dealing with towers due to high attack and HP and so make good siege weapons; Spectre anti tank helicpters with fully upgraded speed, HP and some attack thrown in (bought upgrades AND civilisation uprgades) are devastating as a rapid reaction force, plus with upgraded speed they can outrun unupgraded aircraft; if you get close to an enemy airfield, get a Tempest Cyber to cast Anti Matter Storm over the end of the runway. Enemy planes will then die as soon as they take off; Have artillery guns behind your walls in range of hospitals so they self heal. If snipers are attacking your towers and your artillery cant see them but they are in range, wait for the snipers to fire again so you can see their location and then use attack ground option to drop a shell right on their heads" <u>- Skaulden</u> <b>#</b>"a useful thing to do is to build a handful of cheap fast units with high hp. then get a prophet or two and infect those units with the plague. then send the infected units on a suicide mission to the enemy to infect as many people as possible. aim for citizens as they tend to infect more people" <u>- Achilles</u> <b>#</b>"TO SUPER JUMP THE ACTS MAKE A TOWNCENTER THEN KEEP DOING THAT OVER AND OVER TO GET TO NANO MY RECORD IS 2 MIN FROM PRE. NON CHEATS" <u>- storm</u> <b>#</b>"start off by by sending 12 citz to iron mines then get 6 citz from capitol. build 3 barax with 2 citz on each. then 2 remaining citz to build wall. then when the barax are done send the citz to wood. then all citz you get from capitol send to get food(any type will do.hunting is 30% faster than farms and foraging)." - Lucius <b>#</b>"When you have a huge army double click on one you'll get all or I think you do. -- If your scared that the enemy is stronger create a second wall and just place gates at the same area of your first gate but doing this is very useful and put in between those walls towers and AA guns." <u>- John</u> <b>#</b>" a good way to defend your base while getting resources his after youve built ur wall (epoch III) put some towers in front of the wall and put a bunch of archers behind the wall, when ur enemy comes ur archers n towers just shoot them down n the only way ur archers get hurt is by other archers n catapults, but the more archers n towers u got the better, be sure to upgrade them as much as u can " <u>- papajosh</u> <b>#</b>"Here is a tip for all of you guys...; After you have built a strong economy, make a siege team. Try to do it early in the game. Attack your closest enemy. The siege team should consist of snipers, regulars ( musketeers, axemen, spearmen, etc. etc.) cavalry, and siege weapons.*; Use your sniper (if you got them) and let them protect your main army and siege weapons. Use your regulars to protect the siege weapons and the snipers. Finally use the cavalry to protect all of them and also killing other siege weapons, cavalry, and snipers. Your snipers will fend off the infantry.; Then use your siege weapons to destroy the enemy.; * The units all depends on your epoch at that time*" <u>- WILLIWIN?</u> <b>#</b>"surround your capitol with 8 settlements and populate them into town centers. use these town centers to rapidly create citizens and the capitol in the middle to do upgrades. with these town centers you can quickly recover from any attack.; -- OFFENSE; 1.Make as many horses as you can maneuver at once.; 2.Replace one of these horses with a strategist.; 3.Put all horses in defense position.; 4.Make your army formation be a long line.; 5.Use this army for offensive techniques 6.when ever your horses health lingers, pull your army out of battle and; allow your strategist to heal them, go back in 7.this is very effective if your are trying to defend an area 8.MAKE; SURE YOUR STRATEGIST STAYS ALIVE; DEFENSE; 1.make as many infantry as you can; 2.use these men to patrol constantly until you get a nearly continues line around your empire 3. build hospitals in a row at a place where your men must always pass on the patrol route [this will constantly reheal your line" <u>- Mike</u><br />
                  <img src="ball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt=""/> EE:AOC Tips &amp; Tricks:: <b>#</b>"try and build your aa in groups of 4 every 4 squares and 1-2 squares behind your wall. This'll prevent holes in your air cover" <u>- Roughneck</u> <b>#</b>"This doesn't work all the time, but it'll work most of the time. Once you have enough resources early on in the game, build a barracks and build a sniper or two and rush your nearest enemy and attack the opposing team's citizens. Usually, they won't fight back, but then there's that other 10% of players who will." - Roughneck <b>#</b>"Always have fighters escort your bombers." <u>- jack</u> <b>#</b>"Create ten cits when you first start out in a game this should be the first thing you do so later on you will have more cits and dont have to stoop and build them later on." <u>- {SU}Red army(Rangoon province)</u> <b>#</b>"If you are going to attack a enemy who is in the atomic age or above you should keep some anti aircraft tanks along with a Diffused army &#9001;ie a army which is in groups of 10 or 20 and surrounds the whole enemy base to attack because one nuclear missile will wipe out your whole army and totally you should have an army of about 100.&#9002;" <u>- Anand</u> <b>#</b>"You should always destroy the towers first and then the citizens and then the anti aircraft missile launchers and then the army this is why you should have a mixed army to carry out each purpose. For example tanks and siege weapons for the towers and anti aircraft missile launchers snipers to take out the citizens and bombers to take out the army or also buildings and fighters to take on fighters" <u>- Anand</u> <b>#</b>"This is for Art of Conquest (Space Age):; A sneaky thing to do is to build ~6 or so watchmen and teleport them to an enemy resource area. They will be killed, but you will kill their citizens first, usually. An even sneakier thing to do if the base is relatively undefended is to teleport priests." <u>- the chosen one</u> <b>#</b>"GOOD TIP:When you have a lot of extra recources and your near the water,and you have the dock with subs, create a carrier and set a rally point for it.After that create planes.The planes are exeptional.Tip for space age:if u want an invincible anti aircraft gun that flies, make a tempest and wait for his blue bar to rise.Soon you you can make a anti-matter storm.They are really good but can only attack air units." <u>- Bo Fosta</u> <b>#</b>"Play as Novoya Russia in the Space Age. Consturct the Library of Alexandria, and then construct a missle base. With the buildings identified, have fun nuking the other guys. (it helps if you have allies for troop support)" <u>- King Christopher</u> <b>#</b>"you should keep in mind that when you attack your base id defended because if you send your army towards your enemys town and if he spoted you before you attacked then you are in big trouble because your base might be attacked by the enemy! and without an army near your town you are bound to lose! so make a unbreakeable untoppleable defence and your enemy will be wiped of the map!! if you have friends dont rely on them too much because they might turn against you! have fun breaking into the enemys town!" <u>- Anand (Typhlosion)</u> <b>#</b>"Industrial Age (for beginners): Sets: SH(Standard High), Very Fast. The best way to win this type of game is by rushing. You begin with 20 citz. 6 for iron mine, 6 for gold mine, 6 for wood, the rest to build 1 barrack and 1 stable, 1 granary. Starting this way u will have enough resources since the beginning. Then build Units as fast as posible(build diverse types to counter any enemies units), and destroy your enemy base with no problem by F11 10m. Well, this works if u are not dealing with a pro." <u>- Silence Sound, Twisted : )</u> <b>#</b>"Never underestimate walls, they are excelent when paired with towers and AA behind them (Mortar launchers, archers, and siege weapons are also a huge assistance). Make sure you have have temple, and to a lesser extent, universities, near important areas of your base to prevent prophets, and priets wreaking havoc (belive me they will, especially if teliported in groups). It's a good idea to keep a few towers, and sometimes AA inside your base (another big help if your enemy likes to teliport). If you have extra food, you should try to fill up your settlements / town centers / capitols this way, they'll get bonuses when your citizens deposit food, iron, gold, and/or stone there. ALWAYS ALWAYS_ALWAYS_ send your troops in groups with other types (and medics in later epochs) or else it's highly likely you'll see them fall to thier weakness. Siege weapons are great for attacking someone's defences, buildings, and/or front line due to thier range, and (usually) explosive fire, but keep them backed up with other troops, such as infantry, tanks, and mechs, and most of all, anti air, so that you're attack will be much more effective. If you're playing someone that likes to use nuke bombers, fighter jets will kick thier A**. But most importantly, PRATICE!!!!!!!!!!! I've never seen, or heard of a strategy better then experiance. Oh, and remember it's only a game, if you lose, then play again, 'else you'll never get any better. =)" <u>- DustmanD</u> <b>#</b>"if you're in an early stage, and need to bring down towers, a handful of prophets with the casting of earthquakes will do the trick." <u>- peachfrost</u> <b>#</b>"if you are in a space planet map then the only thing important is to ADVANCE forget about making an army before you reach digital age make lots of citizens and forget walls or towers because walls or towers are no use to space planes.once you reach space age build turnets and docks to protect your base  it wont hurt if you build aa inside your town" <u>- Anand (Typhlosion)</u> <b>#</b>"Use helicopters to clear out anti aircraft. and deploy paratroopers to destroy miners." <u>- bansin</u> <b>#</b>"Don't try to act saddistic as to build turrets as walls. this will cause the computer's memo to fail and thus ur enemy spaceships will not receive any damage. you may like to build wonders in planets map right from the start. it costs cheaper and enemies will not be able to attack you. in the planets large, small or satellite, the following units can be considered as useless: - ALL bombers (there is no need to be so saddistic as to nuke them); - fighters (not fighter/bomber) (aa guns and fighter/bomber will take care of it.; - ALL infantry (these are not good at dealing with enemy units, tanks, cybers are better off than 'em); - planetary fighter (their accuracy and flight time and hp sux)" - eeaoc beginner; "If playing online in a 3 on 3 ,dm ,atomic modern ..... 20 cits, ISLANDS.......LARGE MAP.....; build 10 airports with 1 of each fighter type and build aa in 6 rows in front of the 10 airports . then build a big navy and ;6 carriers filled up. though u must av an economy workin by then have all mines on your island worked on and 2 ;populated granaries.u must upgrade all units in the ariports and navy . your custom civ should be as follows.................fighters.....speed .attack .hitpoints and range if u want ..do not ;bother with fuel ok. .....................................battle ships and carriers must have range.. hit points.. and attack/////////// frigates and cruisers must have attack and subs attack and range the rest u can choose.; A wall shood also be built around your island and towers .it is handy if u and your allys take over a unused island ;and fortify it also aa towers and that sorta stuff share all mines equally.; VICTOR LAZ ........Undefeated Champion" <u>- VICTOR LAZ <b>#</b>"1)</u> When you go to attack the enemy, keep making troops at your base, and you and your towers will most likely be able to take them out.; 2) When playing mid, make ca on pocket and swords on wing!; 3) for mod, i recommend making towers and not a wall, because all units are ranged. if you're playing mid or below then i recommend a wall." <u>- Ananymous</u></div>
